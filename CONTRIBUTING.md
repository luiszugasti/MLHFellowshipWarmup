## Welcome new contributors!

This repo is an initial project for the opening hackathon, Major League Hacking Batch 2 Open Source fellowship. The goal of this project is to demonstrate 
our ability to work in small pods on one of the potential open source repositories we'll be contributing to over the duration of the fellowship. We have chosen
the sktime repo from the Alan Turing Institute to be the main model we're building this project off of. 

Project Owners: Luis Zugasti and Kavin Anand
  - We are two fellows from batch 2.0.2 "Kinetic Kowalski"

Project Contributors: Anyone who wants to contribute to this project!
  - First steps: Please explore the Issues tab for the current problems or feature enhancements we envision for the project and try to tackle those
  - If you have a burning idea, please open it as an issue and a project owner will help answer it right away
  - We'll make sure to name you as a contributor if your code is accepted!
  
Testing is done automatically by the Travis CI function we have established. 
Happy hacking
